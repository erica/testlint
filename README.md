# testlint

Sometimes little thrown-together solutions create greater value than their aesthetics would promise. 

### Setup

* Compile
* Add to Swift project build phases (Target > Build Phases >  or use directly at the command line.

When you do not add arguments, the utility looks for an .xcodeproj folder in the same directory. Run it this way at the top level of a project or as a build script.

No dependencies.

### Options:

    Usage: /Users/ericasadun/bin/testlint options file...
        help:                       -help    
    Use 'NOTE: ', 'ERROR: ', 'WARNING: ', HACK, and FIXME to force emit
    Use 'nwm' to skip individual line processing: // nwm
    Use ##SkipAccessChecksForFile somewhere to skip file processing


### Future directions:

For any of the nuanced features (specifically constructors and public access checks), this tool is either leaky like a sieve or creating false positives all over the place. I'm exploring possibilities but even with these issues, I'm using the utility regularly and am happy with the help it offers.
